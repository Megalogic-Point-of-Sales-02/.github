# Megalogic - Point of Sales

## Introduction
Status quo, with technology advancement, there is also a growth in customer behavior. Hence, there is a significant growing demand for a dynamic solution that would help the industry to keep relevant with ongoing customer trends. Megalogic, as an IT consulting and IT services company, aims to address this demand by developing a Point of Sale (PoS) System that integrates built-in Machine Learning (ML) capabilities. This system will analyze customer behavior, perform market basket analysis, segment customers, and predict customer churn, thereby enhancing retailers' ability to adapt to evolving trends and improve sales strategies. The PoS System will also capture critical customer and transactional data, positioning it as a cornerstone technology of transactional operations. Our research question seeks to explore the potential impact of integrating ML into PoS systems on enhancing business intelligence and optimizing business outcomes. We were prompted by Megalogicâ€™s problem statement, and we are eager to contribute insights to the field of business intelligence, focusing on leveraging data to drive business success.
